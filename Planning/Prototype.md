Terreria is a 2D pixel art game where you will have a character based off the LDHSS Ravens mascot, Otis, who you can control to move around a genereated world with grass, dirt, stone, trees, and caves/tunnels. The game takes place in a procedurally generated world where players can dig, mine, and build structures to create their own unique environment. You will have an Inventory that has all blocks available for user's use. The tunnels and caves will be generated differently every time.
