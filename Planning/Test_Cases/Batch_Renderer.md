### Test Case: Batch Rendering

**Description:** Verify the functionality of batch rendering for improved performance.

**Preconditions:** The game has multiple game objects with sprite renderers that need to be rendered efficiently.

**Steps:**
1. Start the game.
2. Create and add multiple game objects with sprite renderers to the scene.
3. Verify that the sprite renderers are added to the appropriate render batch based on their z-index.
4. Verify that the render batches are sorted correctly based on their z-index.
5. Check that the render batches are created and initialized correctly during the game's initialization process.
6. Trigger a render update.
7. Verify that the render batches are rendered in the correct order.
8. Check that the render batches utilize batch rendering techniques to minimize draw calls.
9. Verify that the appropriate shader is used for rendering the render batches.
10. Check that the render batches correctly upload the projection and view matrices to the shader.
11. Verify that the render batches bind the correct textures and upload the texture IDs to the shader.
12. Check that the render batches bind the correct vertex array object (VAO) and enable the vertex attribute pointers.
13. Verify that the render batches render the sprites using the appropriate OpenGL draw calls.
14. Check that the render batches disable the vertex attribute pointers and unbind the VAO after rendering.
15. Verify that the render batches correctly unbind the textures and detach the shader after rendering.
16. Repeat the test with different combinations of game objects and sprite renderers to ensure proper rendering in various scenarios.

**Expected Result:**
The batch rendering system should effectively group and render the sprite renderers based on their z-index, resulting in improved performance by minimizing draw calls and efficiently utilizing OpenGL's rendering capabilities. The render batches should correctly handle shader and texture bindings, enable and disable vertex attribute pointers, and render the sprites in the correct order based on their z-index.
