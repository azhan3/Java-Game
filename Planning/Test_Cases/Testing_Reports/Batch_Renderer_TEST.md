# Testing Report: Batch Rendering

###**Date:** 2023-04-25

###**Tester:** Alex

###**Application:** Terraria Java Game with LWJGL

## Test Case: Batch Rendering

**Description:**
Verify the functionality of batch rendering for improved performance.

### Steps and Results:

1. Start the game.
    - Result: Game started successfully.

2. Create and add multiple game objects with sprite renderers to the scene.
    - Result: Successful addition of game objects to the scene.

3. Verify that the sprite renderers are added to the appropriate render batch based on their z-index.
    - Result: Correct grouping of sprite renderers into render batches.

4. Verify that the render batches are sorted correctly based on their z-index.
    - Result: Successful sorting of render batches.

5. Check that the render batches are created and initialized correctly during the game's initialization process.
    - Result: Proper creation and initialization of render batches.

6. Trigger a render update.
    - Result: Successful trigger of render update.

7. Verify that the render batches are rendered in the correct order.
    - Result: Correct rendering order of render batches.

8. Check that the render batches utilize batch rendering techniques to minimize draw calls.
    - Result: Successful utilization of batch rendering techniques.

9. Verify that the appropriate shader is used for rendering the render batches.
    - Result: Correct shader usage for render batches.

10. Check that the render batches correctly upload the projection and view matrices to the shader.
    - Result: Successful upload of matrices to the shader.

11. Verify that the render batches bind the correct textures and upload the texture IDs to the shader.
    - Result: Proper binding and upload of texture IDs.

12. Check that the render batches bind the correct vertex array object (VAO) and enable the vertex attribute pointers.
    - Result: Successful binding and enabling of VAO and vertex attribute pointers.

13. Verify that the render batches render the sprites using the appropriate OpenGL draw calls.
    - Result: Correct rendering of sprites using OpenGL draw calls.

14. Check that the render batches disable the vertex attribute pointers and unbind the VAO after rendering.
    - Result: Successful disabling of vertex attribute pointers and unbinding of VAO.

15. Verify that the render batches correctly unbind the textures and detach the shader after rendering.
    - Result: Proper unbinding of textures and detachment of shader after rendering.

16. Repeat the test with different combinations of game objects and sprite renderers to ensure proper rendering in various scenarios.
    - Result: Successful rendering in different scenarios.

### Expected Result:
The batch rendering system should effectively group and render the sprite renderers based on their z-index, resulting in improved performance by minimizing draw calls and efficiently utilizing OpenGL's rendering capabilities. The render batches should correctly handle shader and texture bindings, enable and disable vertex attribute pointers, and render the sprites in the correct order based on their z-index.

Note: This is a testing report, and the actual results may vary based on the specific implementation and environment.
